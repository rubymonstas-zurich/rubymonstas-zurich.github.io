# === "A Bug's Life" relationships Exercise ====
#
# This exercise will augment the previous "A Bug's Life" exercise
# with the notion of relationships between bugs!
#
# Below are a couple of tests. They don't run because the described
# class (Relationship) is not implemented. It's your task to make them pass!
#
# Note: Some tests also require you to change the original Bug class.
#

class RelationshipTest < Minitest::Test

  # This special setup method is automatically run by Minitest before every
  # test that is executed. This helps with setting up your test environment
  # and reduces code duplication.
  def setup
    @father_relationship = Relationship.new('father')

    @father_bug = Bug.new('Harry')
    @child_bug = Bug.new('Larry')

    @father_relationship.bug1 = @father_bug
    @father_relationship.bug2 = @child_bug
  end

  # This tests basic attributes of a relationship: the kind (e.g. 'father' or
  # 'mother') and the two bugs that are part of the relationship.
  def test_relationship_attributes
    skip # remove this line when you want to work on this test
    assert_equal('father', @father_relationship.kind)
    assert_equal(@father_bug, @father_relationship.bug1)
    assert_equal(@child_bug, @father_relationship.bug2)
  end

  # This tests a method that returns a textual description of a relationship.
  def test_relationship_description
    skip # remove this line when you want to work on this test
    assert_equal("Harry is Larry's father", @father_relationship.description)
  end

  # So far, the bugs "know" nothing about their relationships. Let's change that
  # by making this test pass!

    skip # remove this line when you want to work on this test
    assert_includes(@father_bug.relationships, @father_relationship)

  # a textual summary of their relationships.

    mother_relationship = Relationship.new('mother')

    mother_bug = Bug.new('Carrie')

1.  Improve your temperature conversion program from last session and your BMI program using string interpolation!

2.  _Escape sequences_ are a way to add characters to your strings that are not printable. One example is the `\n` escape sequence. Another one is `\r`. Try it out in IRB like this: `puts "123\rA"`. What does it do?
   
    How could it be useful in a program? Maybe your coach knows?

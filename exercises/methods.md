1. In Ruby, methods names can end with a `?`. What's special about these kinds of methods?
2. Look at the official [Ruby documentation for String](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html). Find 3 methods that end with `?`. Read the documentation about them to see what they do and try them out in IRB!
3. Let's try chaining some methods. Take the following String: `"Good work, well done!"`. There is a String method which allows you to remove runs of the same character. E.g. `"Good"` becomes `"God"`. Figure out this method's name using the String documentation. Call this method on the string, then figure out if the resulting new string has an even number of characters using method chaining. In the end you'll have joined 3 methods after the string.
